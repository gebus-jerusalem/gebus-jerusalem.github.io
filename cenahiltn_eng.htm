        <b><font face="Times" size="2">One summer afternoon 
        in 1992, as the chefs of the Hilton Hotel were preparing dinner as usual, 
        a guest suddenly walked into the kitchen. <br>
        <br>
        At first they took no notice, as it was not unusual for curious tourists 
        to wander in to watch them work. Then something strange happened: the 
        man, a member of a German touring party, asked all of the staff to leave 
        the kitchen. <br>
        <br>
        The chef politely but firmly asked the man to go back to his room, which 
        provoked an unexpected reaction: the man flew into a rage and began to 
        throw pots and pans across the kitchen, while shouting that he had to 
        prepare the last supper for his group. <br>
        <br>
        The chef was unable to restrain the bizarre guest and he had to call for 
        help. Eight police officers had a most difficult time controlling the 
        man and taking him away . They later discovered that the man had announced 
        to his group his intention to prepare a dinner. </font></b> </h3>

      he meant the Last Supper, in the true sense of the word, because he was 
      expecting the Second Coming of the Messiah. <br>
      <br>
      The German tourist was yet another victim of the Jerusalem Syndrome. The 
      man was hospitalized for a short time and then sent home. </font></b> </td>
