        <font face="Times">According to tradition, Saint 
        Helen found the cross in a cistern near the Calvary in 326 A.D. It's location 
        was revealed by a Jewish man named Judas, who was tortured before he gave 
        the information. Fifty years later, Saint Cyril from Jerusalem noted that 
        there were fragments of the Cross all over the world. The most important 
        pieces are kept in the Cistercian monastery of La Boissiere in the Loire 
        region of France. <br>
        <br>
        Another fragment has been in the Sainte Chapelle in the Royal Palace in 
        Paris since it was donated by King Louis IX. The largest piece is in the 
        Sainte Gudule convent in Brussels. Since European churches are full of 
        remains of the cross one may conclude there are none left in Jerusalem, 
        but that is not correct. The Greek Orthodox exhibit two pieces, one right 
        below the Calvary, in the Holy Sepulchre Basilica, and the other in a 
        room that is both an office and a Treasury.<br>

        has been written in books and encyclopaedias about the many Christian 
        relics kept in cathedrals all over Europe. The Crusaders were the most 
        tenacious collectors and when they returned to Europe their bags were 
        full of relics. <br>
        <br>
        In addition to the famous Holy Shroud, we have the nails used for the 
        Crucifixion, the thorns of the crown, Jesus Christ's blood, his tears, 
        his navel (umbilical cord) and his foreskin. However, the most important 
        relics are undoubtedly sections from the cross on which Jesus was crucified.

      <font face="Times">It is not easy to view the relics 
      because the Greek-Orthodox monk who has the keys to the Treasury is never 
      willing to open the door; one must be very lucky to get to the Holy Sepulchre 
      at the right time. <br>
      <br>
      Once inside the office, you will see an iron gate on the left, and beyond 
      it, the treasury where the relics are kept. The first thing you will see 
      is a small frame containing a wooden cross. <br>
      <br>
      Wedged inside the cross there is a smaller cross that the Greek Orthodox 
      venerate as a relic from the Holy Cross. If it were an authentic relic, 
      then it would be the fragment from the Cross closest to where Jesus Christ 
      was crucified. </font></b></font>
