        Polo was among those who visited Jerusalem after it had fallen back into 
        the hands of the Muslims during the Crusades; he arrived in 1271, as he 
        had promised the Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan. <br>
        <br>
        In his book "Il Milione", Marco Polo wrote that the Kublai Khan had made 
        a specific request to his father and his uncle, who were then on their 
        first trip to the East. He asked them to bring him back an ampulla of 
        the oil that was burned in the Holy Sepulchre, which was thought to have 
        miraculous powers and had been known throughout the East since the 7th 
        century. <br>
        <br>
        The Kublai Khan was very keen on western religions, which is probably 
        why he made such a peculiar request . At that time the Mongolians had 
        not yet converted to Islam and were still considering Christianity and 
        Buddhism. <br>
        <br>
        The Polos landed at Saint John of Acre while it was still in the hands 
        of the Crusaders, and made a trip to Jerusalem to procure the precious 
        oil to take back to the Kublai Khan.<br>
