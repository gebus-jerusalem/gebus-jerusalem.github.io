      And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended 
      from heaven and came and rolled back the stone (of the opening of the sepulchre)" 
      </i>(Matthew, 28,2). <br>
      <br>
      Saint Arculf, a bishop who spent several months in Jerusalem in 670, told 
      that the round stone used to seal Jesus Christ's sepulchre had been split 
      in half. <br>
      <br>
      One of the two halves was situated in front of the Holy Sepulchre and the 
      second was used as an altar on the Calvary. You can still see the first 
      half in the Angel's Chapel in front of the Holy Sepulchre. <br>
      <br>
      The second half mysteriously disappeared from the Calvary sometime around 
      the 15th century: according to the Franciscan monks it was probably stolen 
      by the Armenians with a stratagem. <br>

        most interesting thing to see is a small 15th century church called Jesus

        hardly ever opens it up.<br>
