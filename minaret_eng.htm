        has produced such a large number of books and articles that J. Purvis 
        decided to publish a bibliography (Jerusalem, The Holy City, 1988). The 
        book contains almost 5000 titles and references, but surely at least five 
        thousand more have been written since its compilation. Reading Purvis's 
        book, one realizes how meticulously each building and stone in Jerusalem 
        have been studied, and some of the conclusions or interpretations are 
        often interesting and peculiar. A good example is an article by Archibald 
        G. Walls that was published in the seventies in a specialised review. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Walls opened his article with a question: Is there a religious element 
        in the two almost identical minarets standing at the north and south of 
        the Rotunda of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which seem to watch over 
        Jesus Christ's tomb? Walls noticed that the two minarets are not only 
        very similar in their form and architectural structure, but they were 
        built around the same time, in the Mameluk period: the first one in 1417 
        and the second one in 1465. </font><b><a HREF="minaret_eng.htm#" onClick="my_openNeWindow('bgminaret.htm','planltl','toolbar=no,status=no,width=535,height=515')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()"

        <br>
        </a></b><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The bases of the minarets are built 
        on two different topographical levels but their summits are the same height, 
        as if the builder of the second minaret had insured it would be as tall 
        as the first.</font> </p>

        </font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Walls studied a planimetry of the 
        area and noticed that the imaginary line that unites the two summits of 
        the minarets runs right over the entrance of Jesus Christ's tomb and that 
        the median point of the line is only two metres away from it. Moreover, 
        this imaginary line lies on the Mecca – Jerusalem axis. <br>
        <br>
        Walls wondered if all these discoveries were merely coincidental, or the 
        results of a precise religious and theological decision on the part of 
        the builders. He came to the conclusion that there is, in fact, a connection 
        between the Muslim buildings and the Holy Sepulchre; of all the traditional 
        places connected to Jesus Christ, the Holy Sepulchre is the only one the 
        Muslims do not accept. <br>
        <br>
        According to the Muslim tradition, Jesus Christ was not crucified and 
        thus was alive when he ascended to Heaven. The Romans actually crucified 
        Judas Iscariot, who had received Jesus Christ's appearance. <br>
        <br>
        (According to one of the ancient Christian sects from Syria, Simon of 
        Cyrene was crucified in Jesus Christ's place.)<br>
        <br>
        Murphy O' Connor, author of one of the most important archaeological guides 
        of Jerusalem, suggested that the Muslims were not trying to "protect" 
        the Holy Sepulchre with the two Minarets, but to "annul" it, because, 
        according to their tradition, it cannot be Jesus Christ's tomb. </font><font size="2" color="#000000">
