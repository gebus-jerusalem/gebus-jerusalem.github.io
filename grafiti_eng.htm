      <div align="left"> <font size="2" color="#311818"> Inside the Basilica of 
        the Holy Sepulchre are dozens of chapels and altars. However, there are 
        also some remote places, behind closed doors or below the present level 
        of the church, which are not accessible to tourists or pilgrims. Every 
        once in a while, one of the monks will produce the key to a mysterious 
        door in order to show a distinguished guest what is hidden behind it. 
        One of these special places is the Armenian Chapel dedicated to St. Helen, 
        an architectural masterpiece in Crusader- Romanic style. A dark, suggestive 
        staircase leads down to the chapel, past hundreds of crosses inscribed 
        on the walls by medieval pilgrims. <br>
        In the magnificent chapel four enormous columns and their relative capitals 
        support the cupola. Right next to the altar is a door, usually kept shut, 
        leading to the chapel of St. Vartan's. This chapel is directly below St. 
        Helen's. St. Vartan's chapel is actually an archaeological dig started 
        by the Armenians in 1978 where some very ancient remains have been found, 
        but unfortunately, only a few "chosen" can view them. <br>
        They have apparently identified a wall belonging to a pagan temple built 
        by Hadrian and dedicated to Aphrodite. (This temple was intended to obliterate 
        the location of Jesus Christ's sepulchre, but according to the Christian 
        tradition, its effect was just the opposite: it preserved the tomb's exact 
        location). Also visible are the foundations of St. Constantine's (336 
        AD), the only remaining part of the original church.<br>
        <i><b>(See: Curiosities: What is the Confectioner Hiding?)</b></i><br>
        On one of the walls is an unusual drawing of a boat that resembles a modern 
        graffiti. </font></div>

          the drawing is an inscription reading, Domine Ivimus ("Let us go to 
          the Lord.") This sentence recalls the beginning of Psalm 122: I was 
          glad when they said to me, "<i>Let us go to the house of the Lord</i>!" 
          Who could have written these words and drawn the boat? Archaeologists 
          are certain that it must have been a Christian pilgrim who arrived in 
          Jerusalem from the sea and thus expressed his joy upon arriving. </font>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#311818">This had to have happened 
          after the destruction of Aphrodite's temple and before the erection 
          of St. Constantine's Basilica: therefore, it must have been about the 
          year 300. This graffiti is the earliest archaeological evidence of Christian 
          pilgrimage to Jerusalem. </font></p>
