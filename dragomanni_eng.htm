          word 'dragoman' comes from turjeman in Arabic, turgemana in Aramaic. 
          This is an Arabic, Turkish or Persian translator who is employed as 
          an official interpreter by embassies and consulates, or as a tourist 
          guide.<br>

          This term was widely used up until World War I but is now heard only 
          locally by Arabs who use the Arabic form, turjeman. Until fifty years 
          ago you could find a listing of all local Dragomans, how to contact 
          them and the precautions to take when dealing with them in all travel 
          guides to the Middle East, from the famous Baedeker's to the Guide Bleu. 
          In the "Guide Indicating Sanctuaries and Historical Sites in the Holy 
          Land" by Fra Lavinio from Hamme, published in 1870, you will find this 
          description: <br>
          <b> <br>
          </b> <b><font color="#FF6600">"Dragomans are widely informed about the 
          country: they know all the roads and can speak different languages. 
          They work as interpreters, guides and intermediators. Before hiring 
          a dragoman, one should ask information about his honesty and capability 
          from trusted sources. Not all Dragomans can give the right explanations 
          about remarkable sites one meets along the way."<br>
          <br>
          </font></b>A dragoman was in charge of finding transport (mules, horses 
          and carriages), shelter for the night (tents or inns) and food. He was 
          supposed to keep away highwaymen and beggars, to obtain special permits 
          and to bargain at the bazaar. He also served as the "cicerone" (guide) 
          at different sites of interest, although he was not always qualified 
          for this role. Dragomans were often westerners who had moved to the 
          East, learned the local language and customs and then acted as escorts 
          for European travellers. </font>

        most famous dragoman in the Holy Land was an American named Carola Floyd; 
        he was a member of the American colony that had settled in Jaffa in the 
        middle of the nineteenth century. He arrived with carriages that he eventually 
        used to escort tourists around the country.<br>
        <br>
        In 1898, he guided the Prussian Emperor Wilhelm I on his visit to Jerusalem. 
        He dressed extravagantlly, and with all his sabres and daggers he looked 
        like an authentic desert Bedouin. </font></font></p>
