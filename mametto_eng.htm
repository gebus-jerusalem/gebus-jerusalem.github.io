      <div align="left"> <font color="00ffff" size="2" face="Times">On the eastern 
        side of the Turkish wall of the Old City you will find a column that protrudes 
        about nine meters above the ground, stretching eastwards towards the Mount 
        of Olives.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="00ffff" size="2" face="Times">According to Muslim 
        tradition, the prophet Mohammed will sit astride this column on the Day 
        of Judgement and strain a horse-tail hair to the Mount of Olives, forming 
        a bridge over the Valley of Jehosephat.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="00ffff" size="2" face="Times">Everyone will have to 
        cross the bridge (after dying and resurrecting). Those with a clean conscience 
        will be assisted by angels, while all the others will unfailingly fall 
        down into the chasm.</font><font color="00ffff" size="2" face="Times">A 
        bridge which souls cross after death is also mentioned in the ancient 
        Persian text Ghata ,hymns attributed to Zoroaster, the founder of the 
        Mazdean religion (7th-6th century B.C.). In this case, too, good souls 
        cross the bridge into Heaven and bad ones fall down into Hell.<br>
        <br>
        A monk called Felix Fabri, a pilgrim from Germany, visited the city in 
        1480. He tells about the column and of a Muslim who arrived in Jerusalem 
        and was greeted by the people as a holy man. One day the man gathered 
        a group of Muslims around him and led them outside the walls to show them 
        how Mohammed would judge his followers on Judgement Day. He climbed on 
        top of the column and sat down, his back to the wall, facing the crowd. 
        He began to prophesy but became so enthralled that he lost his balance, 
        slipped and fell crashing down to the ground.</font></div>
