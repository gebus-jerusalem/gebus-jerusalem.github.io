      <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times"> On the main market street 
        of the Old City, which begins at Damascus Gate and is called in arabic Suk Khan 
        e-Zeit (the olive oil caravansary market), you will find 
        a quaint pastry shop called Zalatimo. The speciality there is a sweet 
        with cheese and walnut filling baked in the oven. The shop is mentioned 
        in the most reputable guidebooks on Jerusalem, and indeed, Zalatimo is 
        well worth a visit, but not just for the pastries. At the back of the 
        shop you will find some extraordinary archaeological remains of the first 
        Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<br>
        <br>
        Here you will see a door, about four meters high, which is braced by a 
        massive stone wall on both sides. This door used to be part of the three-door 
        monumental entrance gate to the first Holy Sepulchre Basilica, built by 
        Constantine in 335 AD and later destroyed by the Caliph Hakim in 1009.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Times">This can be easily verified by checking 
        a famous map known as the Madaba map, which dates back to the sixth century 
        A.D. The section of the map depicting Jerusalem reveals that Suk Khan 
        e-Zeit (the olive oil caravansary market), where the Zalatimo pastry shop 
        is located, was built right on top of the Roman Cardo. </font></p>

            can see three churches on the map: two of them face west while their 
            altars face east (as almost all Byzantine and Crusader churches were 
            oriented). The third church is strangely oriented the opposite way; 
            in fact, the map artist had to draw it backwards. This church has 
            a three-door monumental gate. These elements have convinced historians 
            that the third church is the first Holy Sepulchre Basilica.</font></font></p>

        Constantine wanted the Holy Sepulchre Church to be monumental: thus, it 
        was crucial for the church's entrance to face both the most important 
        street in Jerusalem, the Cardo, and the tomb of Jesus Christ, which was 
        west of the street. The present Holy Sepulchre Basilica is not on the 
        Cardo and does not face the west. Why? When the church was rebuilt by 
        the Crusaders, the Cardo was no longer the main street of the city. Moreover, 
        in the meantime the Muslims had built a mosque in the atrium of the Constantinian 
        building. This limited the extension of the new church, which was subsequently 
        oriented according to tradition, eastwards.</font></font></p>
