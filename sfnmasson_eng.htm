        far from Damascus Gate, if you walk eastwards to where the Turkish walls 
        are built right on the rocks you will arrive at a gate excavated in the 
        stone.<br>
        <br>
        Upon entering the gate, you will be surprised to find yourself inside 
        an immense cave, more than 200 metres long, excavated entirely underneath 
        the Old City. <br>

        As you walk along, you will notice that in several places the stone has 
        been neatly cut because the cave was once used as a stone quarry. <br>
        <br>
        You may wonder when they started using it as a cave; according to tradition, 
        there is no doubt: the cave is generally called "King Solomon's mine" 
        because it was used at the time when the Temple was built.</font></font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">

          very peculiar discovery, made accidentally by the French archaeologist 
          Clermont-Ganneau at the end of the 19th century, could very well prove 
          that the tradition was right. <br>

          </font><font color="#000000" size="2"><font color="#FFcc00">The archaeologist 
          discovered an incision in the rock at the entrance of the cave: it represented 
          an imaginary creature that looked like a sphinx and that recalled an 
          Assyrian bas-relief.</font></font><font color="#FFCC00"> </font></font><font color="#FFCC00">

          dated the incision to the time between the eight and ninth centuries 
          BC, that is, the period of the temple of Solomon. Soon the cave became 
          famous among members of the Freemasonry, who felt a kinship with the 
          builders of the temple of Solomon, whom they considered to be the first 
          Freemasons. <br>

          During the British mandate, the Freemasons' meetings were official and 
          publicised. One of the "rooms" in the cave is still called "the Freemasons' 
          hall". <br>
