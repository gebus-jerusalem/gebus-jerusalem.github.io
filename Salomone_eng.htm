        Walter Juvelius, a Finnish poet who was fond of spiritualism and biblical 
        archaeology, believed he had found a coded scritural passage indicating 
        the place where King Solomon's treasure was kept. According to the passage, 
        which he found in an ancient version of the Book of Ezekiel, the temple 
        priests had hidden the treasure in a cave outside the city accessible 
        by a secret tunnel. <br>
        <br>
        Juvelius was sure that the cave and the tunnel were the same ones that 
        an English Captain called Warren had discovered in 1867. He estimated 
        the treasure was worth at least 200 million dollars and decided to look 
        for someone who would finance him on an expedition to Jerusalem. He could 
        not find anyone but he did make the acquaintance of a certain Montague 
        Brownslow Parker, son of an English Duke, who had fought in the Boer War 
        as Captain. <br>
        <br>
        The two men decided to search for the treasure together. Thanks to his 
        connections, Parker managed to collect $125,000 from various English and 
        American financiers; he then proceeded to Constantinople to get excavation 
        permits from the Ottoman Government. In Constantinople, he came to an 
        agreement with two high officials from the Sultan's Court and promised 
        them half of the treasure. <br>
        <br>
        In the meantime, Juvelius had met an Irish clairvoyant who had discovered 
        the exact location of the treasure during a seance. The two men would 
        work together and send instructions to Jerusalem for the duration of the 
        expedition. </b> </font>

          Parker arrived in Jerusalem. He found the Turkish governor, Azme Bey, 
          eager to collaborate, having realised how much money was involved in 
          the project. <br>
          <br>
          With the help of a few Turkish guards, Parker secretly reopened the 
          shaft Warren had excavated in 1867. In order to placate other foreign 
          archaeologists working in Jerusalem at the time, he asked one of the 
          most important experts on ancient Jerusalem - a Dominican friar called 
          Père Vincent - to help him in his research. </b></font></p>
