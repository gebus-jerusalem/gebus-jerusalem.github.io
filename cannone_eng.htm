        in the month of Ramadan Muslims celebrate the descent of the Koran from 
        heaven to earth by fasting from dawn until sunset each day. Today a precise 
        timetable dictates exactly at what hour to break the fast, but before 
        the invention of clocks the Muslims used a cannon. Salvoes were fired 
        to inform the faithful they could start eating and drinking. </font></div>

        cannon still exists in Jerusalem. Notwithstanding modern clocks, a Muslim 
        family has been seeing to the task of firing it generation after generation. 
        The cannon is situated in a Muslim cemetery called A-Sahara, not far from 
        Damascus Gate and near General Gordon's Calvary (see in this site). <br>

        </font><font color="#99FFCC" size="2" face="Times">The English built the 
        Cannon in 1918 and it was donated by the Jordan Royal Family in 1945. 
        Before that time, an old Turkish cannon was used during Ramadan: you can 
        now see it in the museum near the El Aksa Mosque. Should you find yourself 
        in Jerusalem during Ramadan, go and have a look; it is quite a suggestive 
        scene: the cannon being fired in the midst of hundreds of old tombs and 
        in the background, the chanting of the call to prayer by the Muezzins.
