        the night between the 17th and the 18th of April, following instructions 
        given to them by the Irish clairvoyant, they dug a hole through the floor 
        and went down with a rope to the water wells below.<br>
        <br>
        That same night, one of the attendants who worked at the Mosque had decided 
        to sleep outdoors on the esplanade. He was awakened by the noise, found 
        the infidels digging their way through the esplanade and went round the 
        city streets telling everyone what he had just seen. Parker immediately 
        realised his adventure was over.<br>
        <br>
        He packed his belongings and left Jerusalem in a hurry. However, the news 
        of his excavation arrived in Jaffa by telegraph before he did. He was 
        arrested upon his arrival and accused of stealing King Solomon's crown 
        and ring, the Holy Ark and Mohammed's sword. Parker managed to escape 
        and flee the country by sea.<br>
