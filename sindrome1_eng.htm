        <font face="Times">Every year approximately one 
        hundred tourists suffering from a strange syndrome are hospitalized at 
        the Kfar Shaul Psychiatric facility in Jerusalem. Most of them are American 
        Protestants believing themselves to be Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist 
        or even Jesus Christ himself, who have been found preaching and prophesying 
        around the old city. Professor Bar-el, who has been studying and treating 
        this phenomenon for years, believes that these people suffer from the 
        "Jerusalem Syndrome", a condition brought on by a mystical-religious experience 
        peculiar to the city.<br>
        The cause for this sudden madness, according to Bar-el, is the disappointment 
        people feel when they see the biblical places in the modern-day setting.

        Their desire to ascend to a more spiritual state in the wake of this disappointment 
        eventually leads to unusual and bizarre behaviour.<br>
        <br>
        </font></font><font size="2" color="#660000" face="Times">The symptoms 
        often appear on the second day in town, when they don white cloaks in 
        order to resemble the biblical figures with whom they identify. <br>
        <br>
        This syndrome rarely leads to behaviour which endangers the peace or the 
        public, but some temporary psychiatric intervention is often necessary. 
        <br>

        Bar-el found some resemblance to the "Stendhal Syndrome" of Florence, 
        a similar condition brought on by reactions to works of art and the beauty 
        of the city itself.</font><font size="2" face="Times"><font color="#660000">
